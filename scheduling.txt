Root's crontab settings can be changed by using the 'sudo crontab -e' command

This will use escalated credentials without having to store an admin password in some script, meeting the requirement to update the /usr/bin/terraform file

The following line is added to the crontab file: 
	0 21 * * 0 ~/Scripts/updateterra.sh

2100 sunday UTC would be 0900 NZST

As long as the server is up cron should run the terraform update script at the scheduled time at 0900 NZST Monday every week.
